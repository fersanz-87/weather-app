# 🔧 Debug Instructions - Weather App

## Your App is Now Ready with Enhanced Debugging!

I've added comprehensive console logging to help identify any issues.

## 🚀 How to Test Right Now

### Step 1: Refresh Your Browser

1. Go to your browser where the app is open
2. **Hard refresh** the page:
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### Step 2: Open Developer Console

1. Right-click anywhere on the page
2. Select "Inspect" or press `F12`
3. Click on the **Console** tab

### Step 3: Look for These Messages

When the page loads, you should see:

```
API Key loaded: Yes
```

If you see `API Key loaded: No`, then:

```bash
# Make sure your .env file exists and has:
VITE_API_KEY=a6cf891420ebfcb5963f286152cd2fd6

# Then restart the server:
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal, then:
pnpm dev
```

### Step 4: Search for a City

1. Type a city name (e.g., "London", "Tokyo", "New York")
2. Click the search button OR press Enter
3. Watch the console for messages:

**Expected Console Output:**

```
Search button clicked
getWeatherData called for: London
Fetching weather data...
Fetching current weather from: https://api.openweathermap.org/...
Current weather response status: 200
Current weather data: {name: "London", ...}
Weather data fetched successfully: {...}
```

### Step 5: Check What You See

#### ✅ If It Works:

- You'll see the city name
- Current temperature and weather icon
- Hourly forecast timeline
- 7-day forecast
- **Animated background** (rain, snow, sun, clouds, etc.) based on weather!

#### ❌ If You See Loading Forever:

Check the console for errors. The logs will tell you exactly what's failing.

## 🎨 Weather Backgrounds to Test

Try these cities to see different animations:

- **London** - Often rainy (rain drops animation)
- **Moscow** - Often snowy in winter (snowflakes)
- **Dubai** - Usually sunny (glowing sun)
- **Seattle** - Often cloudy (floating clouds)
- **Tokyo** - Various weather conditions

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "API Key loaded: No"

**Fix**:

```bash
# 1. Check .env file exists
ls -la .env

# 2. Check contents
cat .env

# Should show:
# VITE_API_KEY=a6cf891420ebfcb5963f286152cd2fd6

# 3. Restart dev server
# Stop with Ctrl+C, then:
pnpm dev
```

### Issue: Console shows errors

**Fix**: Read the error message carefully. Common ones:

- `401` = API key issue
- `404` = City not found (check spelling)
- `Network error` = Check internet connection

### Issue: Nothing happens when clicking search

**Fix**:

1. Check console for "Search button clicked" message
2. If you don't see it, refresh the page
3. Make sure JavaScript isn't blocked

### Issue: No animations showing

**Fix**:

1. The animations are triggered by weather condition
2. Check console for "Weather data fetched successfully"
3. The background should change automatically based on weather
4. Try different cities to see different effects

## 📊 What the Console Logs Tell You

## 🎯 Quick Test

Open the browser console and run:

```javascript
console.log("API Key:", import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY);
```

If it shows your API key, Vite is configured correctly!

## 🔄 If Still Not Working

1. **Kill and restart everything:**

```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install

# Start fresh
pnpm dev
```

2. **Access the app at:** `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Check the console** for any error messages

4. **Look at the Network tab** in DevTools to see if API calls are being made

## 📝 Current Server Status

Your dev server should be running at: `http://localhost:5173`

The API key in your `.env` file is: `a6cf891420ebfcb5963f286152cd2fd6` ✅

Everything is configured - just refresh and check the console! 🚀
