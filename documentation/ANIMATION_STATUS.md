## 🎯 Current Status

| Animation   | Status      | Visibility | Notes                      |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| **Rain**    | ✅ Working  | Excellent  | Already tested in London   |

## 💡 Troubleshooting

### If clouds still don't show:

1. Check console for "Creating animated clouds..." message
2. If you see the message, clouds are being created
3. Open Elements panel (F12 → Elements)
4. Find `<div class="clouds-container">`
5. Check if it has 8 child elements with class "cloud-particle"
6. If yes → CSS visibility issue
7. If no → JavaScript issue (share console errors)

### Cloud Visibility Tips:

- Clouds move SLOWLY (50-80 seconds to cross the screen)
- They start off-screen to the left
- Look for soft, blurred, glowing shapes
- They should be more visible now with increased opacity and glow

## 🚀 Next Steps

After refreshing:

1. Search for **"León"** or **"Moscow"**
2. Watch the console for cloud creation logs
3. Look for large, soft, glowing shapes moving across the screen
4. They should be MUCH more visible now!

The rain is already perfect - now let's see those beautiful clouds! ☁️✨
